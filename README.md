# Nur TS
Nur TS is a TypeScript-native collections library. It aims to follow the Java 8 API.

## Why?
I was annoyed at the lack of built-in collections in the JS standard library,so I built this for fun and (no) profit.

## Roadmap
- [x] Queue
- [ ] PriorityQueue
- [ ] LinkedList
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] BinaryTree

### Not Included
- Stack: Built-in array can function as a stack
- Array: Built-in array does the job

## Contributing
I am doing this for fun, so no contributions are necessary!
